# collatz
A calculator for the collatz conjecture, in various!

## submittiing

ideal conditions for the software:

- it should provide the option to manually take input from command line, as well as optionally in the program itself.
- it ideally would add data to an array/list, and then prints that list to the terminal/window.
- for sake of portability, a separate function for calculation would be nice (for sake of portability).

**I'm writing it in the languages I know, try yours!**

My only ask is that you include your username in a subfolder under the language you are writing in. It helps for identification and ensuring the repo stays clean.
