# collatz
A calculator for the collatz conjecture/hailstone sequence, in various languages!

## purpose

A learning method and exercise, to help understand and demonstrate the differences between and functionality of a variety of languages, and an opportunity to collaborate.

## submitting

ideal conditions for the program:

- it should provide the option to manually take input from command line, as well as optionally in the program itself.
- it ideally would add data to an array/list, and then prints that list to the terminal/window.
- for sake of portability, a separate function for calculation would be nice (for sake of portability).

Please include a README describing how to build, run, or generally use the program! Thanks!

**I'm writing it in the languages I know, try yours!**

Even if someone else has already done a program in a language you know, you are still free to do it in that language, as long as there isn't any plagiarism involved.

Please do your work in a subdirectory with your username, etc. `Java/oicleevan`. Feel free to submit a pull request!
