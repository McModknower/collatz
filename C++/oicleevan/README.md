# c++

## running

If you're on Linux or Mac, first make the software with `make`. You can then launch the software with `./collatz {number you want to calculate}`. If a number is not specified, the program will ask you for one during runtime.

### windows

If you're on Windows, you need a third party compiler, and you need to manually compile and run the software.

You can launch it with `.\{name of file} {number you want to calculate}`. If a number is not specified, the program will ask you for one during runtime.
