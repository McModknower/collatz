# java

calculating the collatz conjecture in Java

## requirements

**Java** -> I use openjdk-11.

**Ant** -> Tested with build 1.10.9 on Ubuntu.

## building and running

To build an executable jar, type `ant jar`. This command will build a .jar in `bin/`.

To run, you can then execute the .jar using `java -jar Collatz.jar {number you are to run for}`. If there is not a number included at launch, the program will ask for one during runtime.
