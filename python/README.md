# python

Python 3 must be installed!

## running

To run, run the `launch` bash script. It will ask for a number that you would like to run for, and then launch the collatz.py script.  

Alternatively, type `python3 collatz.py {number you want to be run for}`. The program will fail if a number is not specified!
